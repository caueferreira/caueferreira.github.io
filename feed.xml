Here you will find some posts, the majority will be about my life and experience as a software engineer, but I probably will write about other stuff that I love in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check my &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@caueferreira&quot;&gt;medium&lt;/a&gt; and/or my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/caueferreira&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; for a couple of spoilers of future content.
If you do not know anything about me, which is reasonable since sometimes even I do not know about myself, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://caueferreira.com/about/&quot;&gt;read a few words&lt;/a&gt; I’ve written about me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, take a chair and sit on the floor, for here there will be lots of nice stuff to read!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay awesome :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Cauê Ferreira</name></author><summary type="html">That’s just a classic hello world with a pinch of Star Wars.

That's just a classic hello world with a pinch of Star Wars.
Here you will find some posts, the majority will be about my life and experience as a software engineer, but I probably will write about other stuff that I love in my life.

You can check my [medium][medium-url] and/or my [github][github-url] for a couple of spoilers of future content.
If you do not know anything about me, which is reasonable since sometimes even I do not know about myself, you can [read a few words][about-url] I've written about me.

Nevertheless, take a chair and sit on the floor, for here there will be lots of nice stuff to read!

Stay awesome :)
